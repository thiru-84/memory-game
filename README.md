# My Journey
As someone with 5 years of experience in design which includes UI/UX, I had a strong inclination to make this game visually appealing, responsive, and fun to interact with. I wanted it to truly feel like a game, but the truth is, I never played this specific memory card game before.

To start, I researched similar games online to understand the concepts. I faced many challenges along the way, often encountering failed attempts, syntax errors, and issues I couldn't initially resolve. I spent hours referring to available online solutions, but I realized that, as a junior developer, the key takeaway was not just copying others' work â€” it was figuring out how to identify the core logic behind the game.

Through trial and error, I started understanding how to structure the game, and despite the difficulties with syntax and unfamiliar aspects of coding, I pushed through. I learned that without referencing online solutions, solving these problems would have been even harder. Each failure taught me a valuable lesson in problem-solving and persistence.
